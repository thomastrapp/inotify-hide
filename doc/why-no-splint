Splint cannot handle C99 well. For example:

    void f()
    {
      printf("In f\n");

      int i; // <-- breaks splint ("Parse error")
    }

The necessity to declare variables at the top of the scope was removed in C99. Splint cannot deal with this.

But this splint patch may workaround this issue:
